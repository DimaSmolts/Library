# Library
Project created to learn React by developing simple Library application

## Content
The project contains 2 apps:
* client
* dummy-api (it is used to mock data, should not be treated as a real API app :sweat_smile: )

## .env
Each app has its own `.env.example`
But you can run apps on default ports (9000 for client, 3000 for dummy-api)

## Instructions
From the root folder run
```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```
Create new terminal and run
```
cd dummy-api
npm install
npm run start
```
